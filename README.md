## Normal Daily Mean Temperature

Given some cities in the Greater Cincinnati Tri-State Area, Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana with their normal daily mean temperature from January through December, created a heatmap of the mean temperature for each month on the map. 

## Principal Component Analysis - Eigen Faces

* Imported “faces folder” and performed the Principal Component Analysis on the Faces.
* Visualized the data using parallel coordinates, to visualize the first 12 principal components based on age groups.
* Grouped the images according to their age groups. 

## K Means Clustering
* Performed K-means by using 4096-dimension features.
* Resized the images of the faces and resize them to 100 and need to display faces of each cluster and the average face formed by the cluster.
* Performed K-means using by 100 dimensions data.
* Performed PCA on all faces to reduce the number of dimensions to 100.
* Differentiated the PCA obtained from task 1 and task 2.
